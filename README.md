# VoiceFilter with trainable speaker embedding without reference audio

## Prepare Dataset

1. Download LibriSpeech dataset

    To replicate VoiceFilter paper, get LibriSpeech dataset at http://www.openslr.org/12/.
    `train-clear-100.tar.gz`(6.3G) contains speech of 252 speakers, and `train-clear-360.tar.gz`(23G) contains 922 speakers.
    You may use either, but the more speakers you have in dataset, the more better VoiceFilter will be.

1. Resample & Normalize wav files

    First, unzip `tar.gz` file to desired folder:
    ```bash
    tar -xvzf train-clear-360.tar.gz
    ```

    Next, copy `utils/normalize-resample.sh` to root directory of unzipped data folder. Then:
    ```bash
    vim normalize-resample.sh # set "N" as your CPU core number.
    chmod a+x normalize-resample.sh
    ./normalize-resample.sh # this may take long
    ```

1. Edit `config.yaml`

    ```bash
    cd config
    cp default.yaml config.yaml
    vim config.yaml
    ```

1. Preprocess wav files

    In order to boost training speed, perform STFT for each files before training by:
    ```bash
    python generator.py -c [config yaml] -d [data directory] -o [output directory] -p [processes to run]
    ```
    This will create 100,000(train) + 1000(test) data. (About 160G)
